    "Hello! My name is Matthew Crowe and I'm excited to be finally attempting something to make a better living. I am married, I have a 4 year old little girl and as of today (10/22/25) I have an 8 day old little girl. I'm excited to learn how to speak computer and potentially start a new career. Having said all that, the one thing that I must let you know is that my family comes first and my new daughter will be occupying quite a bit of my time. I have committed to this and will be working as hard as possible to keep up and learn properly!"
